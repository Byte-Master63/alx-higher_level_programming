# 0x10. Python - Network 0

## Project Description

The `0x10-python-network_0` project focuses on understanding basic networking concepts using Python. The project involves working with HTTP requests, exploring different HTTP status codes, and interacting with external resources such as APIs. By the end of this project, you'll have a solid understanding of how to handle networking operations in Python using various libraries and techniques.

## Project Requirements

- Python 3
- Basic understanding of networking concepts like HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.), request headers, and status codes.

## Project Objectives

1. **Make HTTP requests in Python:**
   - Use the `requests` library to send GET and POST requests.
   - Understand different HTTP status codes and how to handle responses.

2. **Working with APIs:**
   - Send and receive data from APIs using Python.
   - Parse JSON responses and extract information from them.

3. **Handle HTTP headers and parameters:**
   - Understand how to set headers and parameters in HTTP requests.

## Key Concepts

- **HTTP Request Methods:**
  - `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, and how to use them with Python.

- **Status Codes:**
  - Common status codes such as `200 OK`, `404 Not Found`, `301 Moved Permanently`, etc.

- **Working with APIs:**
  - Sending and receiving JSON data.
  - Making requests using URLs with query strings.

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.
2. Install the required libraries, if necessary:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
