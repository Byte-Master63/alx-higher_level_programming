# 0x11-python-network_1

## Description

This project focuses on working with Python to interact with the network through various libraries and tools. It builds upon the foundational concepts of Python programming and introduces advanced techniques for handling HTTP requests, parsing responses, and working with APIs. 

The key objectives of this project are to:
- Understand HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Learn to use Python's `urllib` and `requests` libraries for network interactions.
- Handle HTTP response codes, headers, and cookies.
- Interact with APIs and process JSON responses.
- Manage error handling in network communication.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:
1. Understand and implement HTTP requests using Python libraries.
2. Parse and manipulate HTTP response data.
3. Use APIs for data retrieval and manipulation.
4. Debug network-related Python scripts.
