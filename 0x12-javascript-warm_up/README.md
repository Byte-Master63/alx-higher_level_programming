# 0x12. JavaScript - Warm Up

## Project Description

The `0x12-javascript-warm_up` project is designed to introduce the basics of JavaScript programming. In this project, you will explore essential JavaScript concepts such as variables, data types, control structures, functions, and loops. It provides a hands-on approach to practicing JavaScript syntax and features, which are essential for your understanding of the language.

## Project Requirements

- JavaScript (ES6) should be used throughout the project.
- You should be familiar with basic HTML and CSS, as the JavaScript code will often be embedded in or interact with HTML pages.
- No external libraries are required for this project, you will rely on vanilla JavaScript.

## Project Objectives

By the end of this project, you should have a strong understanding of the following:

1. **Variables and Data Types:**
   - Declare and use variables in JavaScript using `let`, `const`, and `var`.
   - Understand the different data types in JavaScript, such as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.

2. **Control Structures:**
   - Work with `if` statements, `for` loops, `while` loops, and `switch` statements to control the flow of your code.

3. **Functions:**
   - Create and use functions in JavaScript to organize and reuse code.

4. **Basic Input and Output:**
   - Learn how to handle input and output in JavaScript, including interacting with the browserâ€™s console.

5. **Basic Debugging:**
   - Debug your code using `console.log()` and understand common errors.

## Key Concepts

- **Variables:** Using `let`, `const`, and `var` for variable declarations.
- **Data Types:** Strings, numbers, booleans, objects, arrays.
- **Control Structures:** `if`, `else`, `switch`, loops (`for`, `while`).
- **Functions:** Function declarations, parameters, and return values.
- **Basic Debugging:** Using `console.log()` to check variable values and error messages.

## Installation

To get started, ensure that you have the following installed:

1. A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.) to run JavaScript.
2. A text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom) for writing JavaScript code.

No additional installation is required, as the code is run directly in the browser.

## Usage

Here are a few examples of the tasks you may complete in this project:

### Example 1: Declaring Variables
```javascript
let name = "Alice";
const age = 25;
console.log(name, age);
